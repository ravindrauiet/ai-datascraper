   ‚Ä¢ **Palette:** The outfit's primary palette is a chic monochrome combination of black and gold.  Black provides a base of sophistication and power, while gold accents add a touch of luxury and warmth.
   ‚Ä¢ **Harmony:** The contrast between black and gold creates visual interest and emphasizes the luxurious nature of the accessories. The lack of additional colors maintains a sleek, focused aesthetic.
